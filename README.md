## DISCLAIMER
This project is **not** intended to replace real‑world, battle‑tested cybersecurity tools.
Re‑implementing cryptographic or security mechanisms is almost always a bad idea in production environments — experts have spent decades hardening the tools we rely on today.

This repository exists purely **for educational and experimental purposes only**
It’s a playground for learning, understanding, and having fun with security concepts, not a secure alternative to established solutions.

Use the code here to explore, break, improve, and understand
but never use it to protect anything that actually matters.
